                      Walking is one of my favorite pastimes. Walking provides numerous physical and psychological advantages. It helps me lose weight, build muscles, strengthen my heart, lungs, and bones, enhance my mobility, and offer me more energy. Walking for me an excellent approach to relax and relieve tension in the muscles and shoulders induced by daily stresses.

I love music. Be it listening to music, singing or even playing the keyboard. Music makes ones daily life interesting. I love music because it makes me feel better. I keep humming some tune a lot of times. These days I don’t listen to music as much as I used to, but yes I still loved music.

I've been involved in athletics since I was in elementary school. Even though I wasn't particularly fond of sports at the time, I enjoyed playing during our school's game hours. I was a jack of all trades and a master of none! These days, job has left me with no leisure to participate in any sport. I've dabbled in a variety of sports, including table tennis and soccer.
